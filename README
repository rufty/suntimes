This utility, suntimes, calculates sunrise and sunset times and also twilight times.
It is based on: https://www.edwilliams.org/sunrise_sunset_example.htm

Parts by me I've released it under either the GPLv2 or the BSD 2 clause license.
Pick either.

Notes:
This is *not* a to-the-millisecond accurate. I've been using is to draw day/night bars
behind weather temperature charts, where 1pixel is about 10minutes.
This passed visual inspection.
Also, early versions (v0.6) was programmed into a NeoPixel Arduino clock, to dim by
sunrise/sunset. Again, adequate for this purpose. (See daybright.txt)

Installation:
It requires the libConfuse configuration parsing library.
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
By default the installation PREFIX, set in Makefile, is /usr/local
This will install $(PREFIX)/bin/suntimes, $(PREFIX)/man/man1/suntimes.1.gz
and $(PREFIX)/man/man5/suntimes.conf.5.gz
No /etc/suntimes.conf or ~/.suntimesrc is installed by default.

Testing:
Testing was dones against data downloaded from:
  https://services.timeanddate.com/api/datadownload/astro.html
The publically available sets were for  Amsterdam, Oslo and Maputo, for year 2020

    ==============================
All errors in seconds.
I believe a main source of error is calculating without atmospheric refractions.
NB Errors can be sufficient to trigger "NeverSets/NeverRises" a day out.
Also ran spot checks for Murmansk (above Arctic circle).
